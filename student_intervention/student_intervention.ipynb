    "* Explanation of the classifier (i.e. effective in analysis of the neighbours).\n",
    "* Techniques for Noise Reductions specific for KNN that improve accuracy[3].\n",

    "* Poor runtime performance when training set is large\n",
    "* Great sensitivity to irrelevant or redundant features and, thus, to classification\n",

    "Decision Tree has the advantages[5]:\n",
    "* Complex decision regions can be approximated by the agreggation of simpler decision locally\n",
    "* A sample is tested against only certain subsets and not against all classes, eliminating unnecessary computations.\n",
    "* Flexibility of choosing different subsets of features at internal node of the tree\n",

    "* Biased gain of information to features with much different number of values.\n",
    "* Overlap, especially when the numver of classes is large, causing, probably, a much larger number of terminals then the actual number of classes, increasing the search time and memory space.\n",
    "* Difficulties in designing and optimal DTC, once the performance strongly depends on how well the tree is designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree is a good candidate, in my opinion, for this project because the features haven't greate values (most of it has few categories, even bynary) and the continuous one is in a small range. Other thing is that the output can be considered boolean. The features appears to complete with small quantity of noise, and no missing data. \n",
